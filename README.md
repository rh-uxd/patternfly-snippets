# PatternFly Code snippets

## What's in this extension

Demo: https://youtu.be/StWxQeFj38U

This extension adds a new section to the Explorer view titled `PatternFly Code Snippets`. 

PatternFly code snippets contains the component snippets necessary to use PatternFly components. The components are organized by type (component/layout) and grouped by category.  There is a global configuration setting that also includes documentation in code comments when a component is added. The link icon on the category header will take you to the documentation page for each component category as well.

The extension also makes the snippets available through code completion. If you start to type `#` or `!`, e.g. `#Alert` you will see a dropdown with components that match the text. If the prefix starts with `#`, then the snippets with comments are loaded. If the prefix starts with `!`, then the snippets without comments are loaded.
