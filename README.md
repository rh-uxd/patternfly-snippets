# PatternFly Code snippets

## What's in this extension

PatternFly code snippets contains the component snippets necessary to use PatternFly components.  The components are organized by type (component/layout) and grouped by category.  There is a global configuration setting that also includes documentation in code comments when a component is added.  Please make sure to refresh the extension using the Refresh icon if the configuration setting is changed.  The link icon on the category header will take you to the documentation page for each component category as well.
